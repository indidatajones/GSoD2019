## Project proposal

Your project proposal is a summary of the documentation work that you would like to complete while working with your chosen open source organization during Season of Docs.

Spend time on your project proposal, bearing the following guidelines in mind.

- Preparatory work:

  * Examine the list of participating open source organizations and choose one or more organizations that interest you. 
  * Take a look at the project ideas that each of your chosen open source organizations has proposed.

- Participating open source organizations

   * If the organization that interests you has not suggested any ideas, you can examine the generic list of project ideas and base your idea on one of those. 
   * You may also choose to come up with your own idea, whether the organization has posted ideas or not.

  - [ ] Get in touch with one or more of the participating organizations to discuss the project ideas. 
    - To make contact, use the organization's email address shown in the list of participating organizations. 
    - Early discussions help you put together a good project proposal.

- Your project proposal on the application form:

- [ ] Open source organization name: Enter the name of the open source organization that you want to work with during Season of Docs. 

  > This must be one of the participating organizations displayed on the Season of Docs website.

- [ ] Open source project name: This is the name of the open source project that you want to work on during Season of Docs. 

  > The project must belong to one of the participating organizations displayed on the Season of Docs website. 
  > For some organizations, the organization name and project name may be the same.

- [ ] The name of your proposed technical writing project. 

  > Supply a short, descriptive title that summarizes the main goal of the work you're proposing.

- [ ] A detailed description. Give as much detail as possible in the description of the technical writing project that you're proposing. 

  > It's fine to enter multiple paragraphs in the description field. Here are some ideas of what to include:
  > 
  > Give details of the documentation you're proposing to create/update. 
  > If you plan to update an existing document or site, include a link and describe the proposed updates. 
  > If you're proposing a new document or a new site, describe the content and audience.
  > Say why you're proposing the new documentation or the updates.
  > If you've discussed the project with someone from the open source organization, include a summary of the outcome of those discussions.
  > Pay attention to the language and style of your proposal. The open source organization may use these as a factor in assessing the proposal.
  > Don't supply a link to your project description. The description should include all the definitive details of your project. 
  > The open source organization must be able to make a selection based on the content of the application form rather than on content held elsewhere. 
  > If you need to link to other content that supplements the description, that's OK, but be aware that only the content of the application form is used for project selection.

### Other important fields on the application form

- [ ] Choosing a standard-length or long-running project

  > The standard period for the doc development phase of Season of Docs is three months.
